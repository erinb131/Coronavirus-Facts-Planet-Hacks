        <h3>How COVID-19 is Spread</h3>
            <p>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Through <strong>respiratory droplets</strong> produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.</li>
                <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
                <li>COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other ways that the virus can be spread include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Touching a surface/object that has the virus on it, and then touching your own mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes</li>
                <li>From animals to people, however, the risk is <em>considered to be low</em></li>
                <li>From people to animals</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Protection Methods</h3>
            <p>Clean and Disinfect</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean high-touch surfaces using soap and water (to reduce number of germs, dirt, and impurities) and then disinfecting (to kill germs)</li>
                <li>To disinfect, use EPA-registered household disinfectant, diluted household bleach solutions (if appropriate for the surface), or alcohol solutions with at least <strong>70% alcohol</strong></li>
                <li>Either wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer that contains at least <strong>60% alcohol</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Social Distancing</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay at least <strong>6 feet</strong> (about 2 armsâ€™ length) from other people</li>
                <li>Do not gather in groups</strong></li>
                <li>Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings</li>
                <li>Follow guidance from authorities where you live</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cloth Face Coverings (Masks)/Gloves</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wear a mask in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, etc.)</li>
                <li>Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it (asymptomatic) from transmitting it to others</li>
                <li>Masks can be made from household items (bandana, old t-shirt, square cotton cloth)</li>
                <li>Children under age 2 or people who have trouble breathing, are unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance, <strong>should not wear a mask</strong></li>
                <li>Wear gloves when cleaning and disinfecting your home as well as when caring for someone who is sick</li>
            </ul>
