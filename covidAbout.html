            <li>COVID-19 is called a “novel” coronavirus because it has not been previously identified.  COVID-19 is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, such as the common cold. Therefore, if you have COVID-19, then you will be evaluated and cared for differently than someone who is diagnosed with a common coronavirus.</li>

            <li>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir  COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China.  Many of these patients had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Most international destinations, along with the United States, now have ongoing community spread of COVID-19.
